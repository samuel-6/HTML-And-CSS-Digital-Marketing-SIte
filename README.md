# HTML And CSS Digital Marketing SIte


## Description

This project is aimed at refactoring the codebase of a marketing agency's website to follow accessibility standards. The motivation behind this project is to ensure that the website is accessible to everyone, including those with disabilities, through assistive technologies like video captions, screen readers, and braille keyboards. In addition to improving accessibility, following these standards also optimizes the site for search engines.

In the process of refactoring the code, semantic HTML elements were used, a logical structure independent of styling and positioning was followed, accessible alt attributes were added to the image elements, heading attributes were placed in sequential order, and a concise, descriptive title was added to the title element.
