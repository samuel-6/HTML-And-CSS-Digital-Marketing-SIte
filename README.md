# <HTML-CSS-GIT-CHALLENGE>

## Description

In this repository there's the code necessary for the first week challenge "HTML-CSS-GIT-CHALLENGE"

- The main motivation behind this project is the incorporation of different HTML and CSS elements and it's deployment through GIT.
- I build this project to test my knowlede and push into my current abilities.
- It solves a previous given code with a bad syntaxis and converts it to a good one through goo HTML and CSS semantic.
- During this process I learned to read code, merge repetitive classes and ids into one and how to write good comments.

## Installation
